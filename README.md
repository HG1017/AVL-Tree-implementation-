# AVL-Tree-implementation-
This is the implementation of the important operations of an AVL tree.
For the implementation of the AVL tree, many functions like get_height, balance_factor, turn_left, turn_right, insert and search are created 
and proper comments are provided in the source code to provide explanation at the appropriate places. To start with, an AVL tree is created with elements 0,1,2,3,....,24 inserted in the same order. Thereafter, the options to perform the various operations have been provided using the switch case statements. Choosing 'i' enables the user to insert a new element in the AVL tree, 'p' leads the preorder and inorder traversal sequences to be printed, 's' enables the user to search for an element in the tree, if present, it also prints the balance factor and the height of the node containing that element to be printed. If the element is not present, it prints the same.
Also, the user may choose 'q' to quit the program at any time.
